			libutc -- UTC Time Services

  This project contains the UTC API defined by DCE and used for DTSS in
  DECnet/OSI for OpenVMS, Ultrix and Tru64.

  Added to the standard services are the time conversion routines making it
  possible to convert between UNIX, OpenVMS and UTC time formats.

  The developers of this software would like to acknowledge the efforts
  of the developers involved in developing the UTC API code libutc use.
  The code is derived from FreeDCE, which is the reference implementation
  of the DCE specification published by the Open Group which appears to be
  built using the DECnet/OSI DTSS services developed by Digital Equipment
  Corporation.
